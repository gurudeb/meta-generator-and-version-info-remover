# Meta Generator and Version Info Remover
<strong>WordPress plugin</strong>

This plugin will remove the version information that gets appended to enqueued style and script urls. It will also remove the Meta Generator in the head and in RSS feeds. Adds a bit of obfuscation to hide the WordPress version number and generator tag that many sniffers detect automatically from view source. Option available to selectively exclude any style or script file from version info removal process.

Enable/disable each removal options from admin dashboard:
<ol><li>Remove Meta Generator Tag</li>
<li>Remove Version from Stylesheet</li>
<li>Remove Version from Script</li>
<li>Exclude files from version info removal process (by providing comma separated file names)</li></ol>
